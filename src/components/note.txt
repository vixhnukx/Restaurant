useParams - hook used to access params from component url


REDUX
.....

coupling   -  many connections between parent and child component

props drilling - i coupling if any intermediate component have any errors all other childs will not work


to avoid props drilling we need to reduce couplingand make all the component independent

of this react introduced a new technology - state management technology - REDUX


REDUX process
.............

create a new js file to keep the state . all the components can access the js file


- te components only can access the data from the js file but they cant update the js file

- Action - a file with all the logics to update the state
- Dispatch - methord used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updaton
- Reducer - update the datas in js file according to the payload response get from action file
